<h1>Research Projects</h1>
	
My scholarly research projects span a range of themes and subjects, including British imperial and colonial history, business and economic history, and Australian environmental history.

<p><h2>Scotland and the British Empire</h2>
<p><i>2009-present</i>

<p>I have researched and written widely on the history of the Scotland and the British Empire. In 2019 I am a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/library/researchfellows/benjaminwilkie/">Visiting Research Fellow at the University of Glasgow</a>, supported by the William Lind Foundation, where I am working on a project entitled <i>Commerce, colonisation, and Scotland’s civilising mission in central Africa: A case study of the African Lakes Corporation in the late-19th century</i>. My research explores Scottish commercial activity in Nyasaland, or modern-day Malawi, from the late-nineteenth century. What would become the African Lakes Corporation – the Livingstonia Central Africa Corporation – was established in 1878 in association with the Free Church with a view to undermining the slave trade and replacing it with legitimate commerce; the African Lakes Corporation became a key operator in Nyasaland. This economic and missionary activity was crucial to the expansion of British imperial control over Nyasaland and the broader region.</p>
	
<p>Otherwise, I have been broadly interested in Scottish social networks, business connections, migrations, and culture abroad, and my PhD thesis explored the historical relationships between Scotland, Australia, and the British Empire. I am currently researching a comparative history of Scottish trade, enterprise, and investment and their contribution to the development of colonial economies. In 2014, I was nominated as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. My book, <em>The Scots in Australia 1788-1938</em>, was the first in the Scottish Historical Review Trust's second monograph series, and was published by Boydell Press in November 2017. I have also been a regular contributor to popular Scottish magazines, newspapers, and online media.  I am currently an Associate of the Centre for Irish and Scottish Studies at the University of Otago, Dunedin.</p> 

<h2>Networks of trust, knowledge, and power</h2>
<p><i>2019-</i>	   
<p>As a Research Assistant in the Faculty of Business and Economics at Macquarie University, I am currently working on the project <i>Networks of trust, knowledge, and power: Interlocking directorates in Australian corporations over the twentieth century</i>. Company directors exert considerable influence over firms. Throughout the twentieth century, personal and family capitalism gradually gave way to professional management, with individuals sitting on the boards of multiple companies. Connections between board members may be positive for diffusion of innovations and mitigation of risk, while concentrating corporate control within a small group may have negative implications for business ethics, leadership, and diversity. There are many causes and consequences of interlocking directorates, and this project aims to understand the structure of director networks and the influence of these connections on knowledge and strategy within firms.

<h2><i>Gariwerd: A History of the Grampians</i></h2>
<p><i>2016-2019</i>
<p>My second book, <em>Gariwerd: A History of the Grampians</em>, is an environmental and history of the Grampians-Gariwerd mountain ranges in the Western District of Victoria, and is to be released by CSIRO Publishing in 2020. It explains the geological and ecological significance of the Grampians/Gariwerd mountains, and describes over 20,000 years of Indigenous Australian history in and around Grampians-Gariwerd, including archaeology and traditional ecological knowledge. The book explores the history of colonisation and its impact on both Indigenous Australians and the environment, and details the rise of science, industry, and tourism in Grampians/Gariwerd. It considers the creation of the Grampians National Park in the twentieth century and examines current issues to do with the park. Research from this project published as 'Rights, reconciliation, and the restoration of Djabwurrung and Jardwadjali names to Grampians-Gariwerd' in the <i>Victorian Historical Journal</i> was shortlisted for the Royal Historical Society of Victoria's inaugral John Adams Prize for best article on Victorian history in 2017-18.</p>  
	    
<h2>Wildlife conservation, land management, and militarised landscapes</h2>
<p><i>2016-2018</i>
<p>Supported by a 2016-17 Australian Army History Unit Research Grant for the project <i>Nature conservation and militarised landscapes: A case study of Puckapunyal since the First World War</i>, I have researched the history of environmental changes at military training areas in Australia and the broader evolution of sustainable land management practices in the Australian defence forces. This project resulted in a number of publications and papers, including ‘Defending nature: Animals and militarised landscapes in Australia’, in Nancy Cushing and Jodi Frawley (eds), <i>Animals Count: How population size matters in animal-human relations</i>, Routledge, 2018; 'Bombs and biodiversity: A case study of military environmentalism in Australia’,<i>Arcadia: Explorations in Environmental History</i>, vol. 15, 2016; 'Australian environments in war and peace: Toward an environmental history of Australia's defence estate', Australian Historical Association Conference, Ballarat, July, 2016; and 'Defence white paper shows Australian forces must safeguard nature', <i>The Conversation</i>, February 26, 2016.
