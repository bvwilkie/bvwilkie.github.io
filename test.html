<h1>Environmental restoration at Puckapunyal</h1>

<h2>Ben Wilkie</h2>

<p><em>This post is the draft of a short piece I have written for Arcadia: Explorations in Environmental History.</em> </p>

<p>Puckapunyal Military Training Area, in central Victoria, Australia, is home to 44,000 hectares of box-ironbark ecosystem, of which over three-quarters has been cleared elsewhere in Victoria. There are twelve endangered or vulnerable vegetation communities. The area is home are around 481 indigenous and 225 introduced plant species, and 170 species of lichens, mosses and fungi. There are 185 native bird species, 17 indigenous and 15 introduced mammals, 12 kinds of bat, 18 species of reptile and 12 species of amphibian, seven native and four introduced kinds of fish, and over 140 species of invertebrates. It is a rich site of biodiversity and holds high conservative value, but it was not always so</p>

<p>The relationship of military forces to the natural environment is typically depicted as one of destruction, rather than protection. Globally, however, military forces are holding increasingly important, complementary roles in the defence of high conservation value sites. Scientists have often observed that training areas used by the defence forces have provided sanctuary for numerous species of flora and fauna. While seemingly high-impact training takes place in such areas, the net impact on the surrounding environment is often much less extensive than the impact of recreation and tourism in national parks.</p>

<p>The incorporation into defence policy of the notion of military training areas as de facto wildlife reserves is a key feature of military environmentalism, along with stringent environmental processes and controls, and greater focus on transparency and accountability in matters relating to the environmental impact of defence activity. ‘Swords to ploughshares’ programmes, in which disused military sites are turned over to conservation, are also becoming more commonplace.</p>

<p>Some have claimed that increasing emphasis on conservation in the past few decades is merely rhetoric to justify and ‘greenwash’ military occupation of land, and to hide environmental damage. Others have pointed out that what matters is the end result – and scientists frequently point to the unexpected environmental benefits of military sites from which most human activity is excluded.</p>

<p>One case in which the military made a positive and concerted effort at conservation is found at Puckapunyal. Its restoration in the 1970s and 1980s is perhaps one of the earliest examples of military environmentalism in Australia, a topic well covered in other parts of the world but deserving of more consideration in the Australian context.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of European settlement in the mid-nineteenth century, the land around Puckapunyal was utilised for intensive sheep and cattle grazing, later followed by gold mining and logging for timber and firewood in the area’s box and ironbark forests. Land degradation and accelerated soil erosion was, by the early-twentieth century, severe in most parts of the area – the duplex soils at Puckapunyal were and are particularly susceptible to erosion after disturbance.</p>

<p>Military training began at Puckapunyal during the First World War, and the Department of Defence formally purchased the land during 1939. It became one of the largest infantry training sites in Australia, and from 1949 was home to the 1st Armoured Regiment. Historical land use impacts and heavy military usage, with little attention paid to land management or maintenance, had left the area barren and denuded. By the 1960s, parts of the site were impassable because of waterlogging and severe erosion; for the tanks of the armoured division, these areas were unsafe and unusable.</p>

In 1969, the Department of Defence chose to retain and restore the training site. The Puckapunyal Restoration and Conservation Project began work in 1971. Officially operating under the auspices of Defence, the research and scientific support for the project was provided by the CSIRO, while the Victorian Soil Conservation Authority managed operations and provided its expertise in soil erosion and land restoration.</p>

<p>By 1985, the extensive programme of earthworks, soil and water erosion control, and revegetation had been completed over 20,000 hectares of land. Some 5000 hectares of barren and denuded landscape was repaired, and 16,000 hectares of improved pasture had been established. At the completion of the project, land management and scientific officers were appointed to continually monitor and research the Puckapunyal site. A rest and restore programme was implemented, creating ‘no go’ areas where the land was being overused, new vegetation was establishing or was otherwise environmentally sensitive, or where research was being conducted.</p>

<p>Throughout this process, the Department of Defence had no formal environmental policy. From 1993, however, the <em>Australian Army Environmental Policy</em> came into effect – the first of its kind in Australia. The <em>Commonwealth Endangered Species Protection Act 1992</em>, provided further pressure on Defence – as Australia’s biggest landholder – to take an active role in conservation and sustainable environmental management.</p>

<p>This was emphasised in the <em>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</em>, followed by a Defence Environmental Policy in 2001 stating that the ‘Department of Defence will be a leader in sustainable environmental management to support the ADF’s capability to defend Australia and its national interest’. Most recently, the 2016 Defence White Paper observed, “Effective environmental management is an important part of successfully managing and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Defence estate. The Government expects Defence to take its environmental stewardship responsibilities seriously, and to comply with relevant environmental legislation and regulations, including the protection of biodiversity on Defence bases.”</p>

<p>The evolution of both land management at Puckapunyal and broader Defence environmental initiatives from the 1970s until the present are examples of military environmentalism in an Australian context – a topic yet to be fully explored by Australian environmental historians. Regardless of debates around the potential cynicism and propaganda motivations of ‘khaki conservation’, the case of Puckapunyal suggests that we should recognise the complementary role defence forces can play in environmental management. Environmental historians can take an active role in highlighting, encouraging, and informing such policy agendas.</p>
