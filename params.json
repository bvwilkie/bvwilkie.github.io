I have recently finished a book on Scotland, Australia, and the British Empire, and I teach in the Australian Studies programme at Deakin.\r\n\r\nContact me [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/historyben) or [email me.](mailto:ben.wilkie@deakin.edu.au)\r\n***\r\n#Research <a name=\"Research\"></a>\r\n\r\n##Grampians-Gariwerd\r\nRecently, I have been researching the environmental, social, and cultural history of the Grampians-Gariwerd national park in the Western District of Victoria. I am interested in its geological and ecological development, its Indigenous and European histories, its more recent story as a national park, including Indigenous planning and land management, and conservation issues into the future. My book, tentatively titled The Grampians: History and Nature, is to be released by CSIRO Publishing.\r\n\r\n##The Scots in Australia\r\nSince 2009, I have researched and written widely on the historical relationships between Scotland, Australia, and the British Empire. I have explored Scottish identity and culture in Australia, Scottish-Indigenous relations, visual and material culture, and the role of space and place in the migrant experience. My book, The Scots in Australia 1788-1938, will be published Boydell & Brewer.\r\n\r\n##Environment and war\r\nSince late-2015, I have been exploring the many intersections of Australian environmental and military history. In particular, I am interested in the environmental impacts of war on the Australian homefront. I am currently investigating environmental changes at military training areas and the broader evolution of sustainable land management practices in the Australian defence forces.
