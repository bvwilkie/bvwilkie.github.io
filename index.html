</h1>

<p>I am an Australian academic based at Deakin University, Warrnambool, and I research, write, and share histories of Australia's culture and environment. </p>

<p>I am currently writing a new history of the Grampians-Gariwerd national park, and investigating the intersections of Australian environmental and military history. I have recently finished a book on Scotland, Australia, and the British Empire, and I teach in the <a href="http://www.deakin.edu.au/courses/find-a-course/humanities-and-social-sciences/australian-studies">Australian Studies</a> programme at Deakin.</p>

<p>Recently, I have been researching the environmental, social, and cultural history of the Grampians-Gariwerd national park in the Western District of Victoria. I am interested in its geological and ecological development, its Indigenous and European histories, its more recent story as a national park, including Indigenous planning and land management, and conservation issues into the future. My book, tentatively titled The Grampians: History and Nature, is to be released by CSIRO Publishing.</p>

<a id="the-scots-in-australia" class="anchor" href="#the-scots-in-australia" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Scots in Australia</h2>

<p>Since 2009, I have researched and written widely on the historical relationships between Scotland, Australia, and the British Empire. I have explored Scottish identity and culture in Australia, Scottish-Indigenous relations, visual and material culture, and the role of space and place in the migrant experience. My book, The Scots in Australia 1788-1938, will be published Boydell &amp; Brewer.</p>

<a id="environment-and-war" class="anchor" href="#environment-and-war" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Environment and war</h2>

<p>Since late-2015, I have been exploring the many intersections of Australian environmental and military history. In particular, I am interested in the environmental impacts of war on the Australian homefront. I am currently investigating environmental changes at military training areas and the broader evolution of sustainable land management practices in the Australian defence forces. Click here to read a blog I write on environmental histories of war.</p>
