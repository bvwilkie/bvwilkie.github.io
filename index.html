	<p>I am a historian with broad expertise in British and Australian imperial and colonial history, Australian business history, and Australian environmental and geological histories. In imperial and colonial history, my research has focused on Scotland and the British Empire, with a particular emphasis on Australia. My first book was <a target="_blank" href="https://boydellandbrewer.com/the-scots-in-australia-1788-1938-hb.html"><i>The Scots in Australia: 1788-1938</i></a> (Boydell Press 2017), and I am currently investigating the contribution of Scottish trade, commerce and investment to colonial economies in Australasia and Africa. In business history, I am working with colleagues to research the corporate elite in twentieth century Australia, the nature and impact of interlocking directorates in large Australian firms, and the history of multinational enterprises in Australia over the last one-hundred years. A local of the Western District of Victoria, I am also active in environmental history, and my most recent major publication is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.publish.csiro.au/book/7721/"><i>Gariwerd: An Environmental History of the Grampians</i></a> (CSIRO Publishing 2020); I am currently researching histories of the Newer Volcanics Province of south-east Australia. I am also a freelance writer and contribute to a range of publications on diverse subjects including <a target="_blank" href="https://www.limelightmagazine.com.au/writer/ben-wilkie/">classical music</a>, religion, and history.

      <h3>Empire</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">Scotland and the British Empire</p>
      <p>My research on the histories of Scotland and the British Empire has focused on Scottish migration, settlement, culture, businesses, and politics in Australasia and, more recently, Africa. I am the author of <a target="_blank" href="https://boydellandbrewer.com/the-scots-in-australia-1788-1938-hb.html"><i>The Scots in Australia: 1788-1938</i></a> and in 2019 was a Visiting Research Fellow at the University of Glasgow. I am currently an Associate of the Centre for Irish and Scottish Studies at the University of Otago, and I am researching the role of Scotland in the development of economic life in British colonies. I blog regularly at <a href="https://thescottishaustralian.wordpress.com/"><i>The Scottish Australian</i></a>.</p>

      <h3>Enterprise</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">Australian business history</p>
      <p>As a research assistant in business history at both the Macquarie Business School and the University of Wollongong, I am working with colleagues on projects that research the corporate elite in twentieth century Australia, the nature and impact of interlocking directorates in large Australian industrial and financial firms, and the history of multinational enterprises in Australia over the last one-hundred years.</p>

      <h3>Environment</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">Victorian environmental history</p>
      <p>My second book, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.publish.csiro.au/book/7721/"><i>Gariwerd: An Environmental History of the Grampians</i></a>, is an environmental and social history of the Gariwerd mountain ranges and Grampians National Park in the Western District of Victoria. I have also published on the history of land management and conservation in Australia's defence forces. As an Honorary Associate at La Trobe University's Centre for the Study of the Inland, I am currently researching the environmental, social, and economic histories of the Newer Volcanics Province of south-east Australia.</p>
