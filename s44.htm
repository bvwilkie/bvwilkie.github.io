<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
    The immediate postwar period was a time of expansion for the Catholic
    Church in Australia. In the middle of the 1950s, 93 new Catholic churches,
    two new hospitals, four new orphanages, and nearly 40 boys’ and girls’ high
    schools had been built; Catholic primary school enrolments grew by over
    30,000 pupils, and high school enrolments had grown by around 5000
    students; 80 new priests were ordained, and 163 women became nuns in those
    years. A former Anglican Archbishop of Sydney, Sir Marcus Loane, described
    the 1950s as “a decade of spiritual renewal” for Catholics in Australia.
</p>
<p>
    A renewed presence in Australian religious life, however, and high-profile
    interventions in contemporary issues, opened new entry points for sectarian
    polemic shaped by local affairs. Benjamin Edwards notes that
    interdenominational relations in the postwar decade were marked by
    Protestant co-operation and Catholic isolation. As Edwards has argued,
    nevertheless, although sectarian polemic in the 1950s “was sometimes
    triggered by contemporaneous local contingencies, it was framed within the
    traditional sectarian discursive context.” That is to say, while the
    sectarianism of 1950s Australia was shaped by local and sometimes new
    concerns, polemic drew on old ideas and language.
</p>
<p>
    One element of anti-Catholic discourse that was sustained and appropriated
    for Australia was the assertion, as Edwards describes it, “that Catholics
    cannot be loyal subjects of sovereign states because they owe a higher
    loyalty to the Pope, a foreign temporal power.” Indeed, when British
    governance first came to Australia, it brought the old prejudices with it.
    Mere days after the First Fleet arrived in January 1788, on February 13,
    Arthur Phillip pledged allegiance to the King in the presence of the new
    colony’s judge-advocate. After first announcing that “I do believe that
    there is not any Transubstantiation in the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper
    or in the Elements of Bread and Wine at or after the Consecration thereof
    by any Person whatsoever”, Phillip “acknowledged and declared George III to
    be the only lawful and undoubted sovereign of this realm, and that he
    abjured allegiance to the descendants of the person who pretended to be the
    Prince of Wales during the reign of James II.” Alas, Bonnie Prince Charlie
    – exiled leader of the Scottish Jacobite cause – would die in Rome on
    January 31, 1788.
</p>
<p>
    The notion was, perhaps, most infamously articulated in the words of
    British Prime Minister William Gladstone in 1874, writing in response to
    Pope Pius IX’s <em>Syllabus of Errors</em>: “No one can now become [Rome’s] convert
    without removing his moral and mental freedom, and placing his civil
    loyalty and duty at the mercy of another.” About 75 years later in
    Australia, this sentiment was raised again in a unique and high-profile
    manner with the suggestion that lay Catholics were, due to their faith,
    still beholden to a sovereign and foreign power and thus incapable of
    proper allegiance to Australia.
</p>

<h3><em>Crittenden v Anderson</em></h3>

<p>
    In August 1950, <em>The Argus</em> in Melbourne informed readers that a High Court
    judge had ruled on “the question of whether a Roman Catholic could be a
    member of Parliament.” One Henry William Crittenden had run as an
    independent candidate for the electorate of Kingsford Smith in the 1949
    Federal election. He was unsuccessful. Crittenden’s successful opponent was
    Gordon Anderson, a railway worker and unionist who had served four terms as
    the Labor Mayor of the Waverley Municipal Council in the eastern suburbs of
    Sydney. The Argus announced that, some months later in January 1950,
    Crittenden had challenged Anderson’s nomination and election. “He claims
    that the Commonwealth Constitution bars Anderson from being a member of the
    House of Representatives,” it said. “Crittenden submits that the Roman
    Catholic Church is an integral part of a world-wide political regime headed
    by the Pope, as sovereign pontiff and ruler of a foreign power.”
</p>
<p>
    The grounds for Anderson’s election to be made void, thought Crittenden,
    were laid down in Section 44 of the Australian Constitution: any person who
    “is under any acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a
    foreign power, or is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or
    privileges of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power … shall be
    incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the
    House of Representatives.” This article briefly examines the mid-twentieth
    century context and background of the case, details some of content of the
    accusation levelled at Anderson and, by extension, all Catholics in
    Australia, and outlines the eventual judgement that Catholics could, in
    fact, run for office in Australia. Although sectarianism in postwar
    Australia was muted in comparison to earlier decades, it was not entirely
    absent from public discourse.
</p>
<p>
    The 1949 election campaign in the New South Wales electorate of Kingsford
    Smith had, by some accounts, presaged Crittenden’s more formalised attacks
    on the rights of Catholics in Australia. When it reported on the petition
    in January 1950, <em>Truth</em>, a newspaper known for scandal and gossip, suggested
    that there had been a “flood of anti-Roman Catholic propagandist literature
    in the division during the campaign.” It indicated that “Feelings of deep
    indignation had been aroused in the Roman Catholic community in Kingsford
    Smith, and the cause of certain Liberal candidates, who are Protestants and
    who are alleged to have been responsible for the propaganda, is believed to
    have suffered materially in consequence.” Crittenden in particular had a
    track record for sectarian polemic.
</p>

<p>
    Crittenden was described as “the moving spirit in a plan to form a new
    political party” in 1943, to go under the name of British-Australian Union,
    to combat the “blatantly anti-British Irish fifth of Australia … it was
    anti-trade unionists; anti-labor governments; anti-Communists, anti-party
    governments, and anti-religious denominational schools.” Later, in 1947, he
    attempted to establish his own newspaper, which would be called the
    <em>Monitor</em>. It would “endeavour to preserve a high moral tone from the
    British-Australian viewpoint while ruthlessly challenging any and all
    attempts by minorities to further prejudice or destroy our British heritage
    of freedom and equal opportunity.”
</p>
<p>
    His viewpoint would become more openly sectarian. Writing for the
    virulently anti-Catholic publication, <em>The Rock</em>, in May 1950, Crittenden
    levelled criticism at the popular Catholic apologist and writer, Leslie
    Rumble, exposing a swath of religious, ethnic, and class prejudices. He
    described Rumble’s title – doctor – as “unacceptable” because it “would
    prejudice the dignity of less pretentious witch-doctors of other more
    primitive branches of pagan theology.” Rumble was a convert to Catholicism
    from Anglicanism, and Crittenden said it was “difficult for me to accept
    that you were trained for the Anglican ministry in the English traditions
    of decency, as you still permit your readers to believe. It seems that St
    Ligouri’s [sic] villainous ‘Moral Theology’ is hardly the textbook for
    transforming congenitally handicapped Irish students into gentlemen.”
    Catholicism was a “perfectly balanced compound of polytheistic paganism and
    Machiavellian politics … the hybridised product of the union of early
    Christianity with still earlier paganisms”, he also wrote. Touching on the
    Gladstonian fears for civil allegiance, Crittenden said that Catholicism –
    a “foul racial-religious-political combination” – had “corrupted all our
    British institutions in Australia; poisoned our National soul; and, from
    its present domination, now threatens our entire future as a great State.”
    This was the sectarian background from which emerged the suggestion that
    Catholics could not, under Section 44 of the nation’s constitution, be
    eligible for public office in Australia.
</p>
<p>
    In the petition presented to the courts, Crittenden alleged that “Gordon
    Anderson is not capable of being chosen or of sitting as a Member of the
    House of Representatives he being under acknowledgement of adherence,
    obedience and/or allegiance to a foreign power within the meaning of
    Section 44 of the Commonwealth Constitution.” Elaborating on the
    accusation, Crittenden said that Anderson “was, at the time of his
    nomination and election, a professed member of the Roman Catholic Church.
    As such he, as in the case of all members of that Church in all countries,
    is under ‘acknowledgement of Adherence, Obedience or Allegiance to a
    Foreign Power’ – the Papal State. He is therefore incapable of being chosen
    or of sitting as a Member of The House of Representatives.” Crittenden
    believed that his case was bolstered by the fact that “the sovereign status
    of the Vatican was restored through the signing of the Lateran Treaty of
    1929 by Mussolini and Pope Pius XI.”
</p>
<p>
    Sir Wilfred Fullagar was the High Court judge – sitting as a Court of
    Disputed Returns under the Commonwealth Electoral Act – who would hand down
    the final judgment on Crittenden’s petition. An erudite Melbourne lawyer
    with a staunchly Presbyterian outlook – and therefore, perhaps, having some
    understanding of religious minorities in a predominantly Anglican nation –
    Fullagar was described by his friend, the judge Sir Owen Dixon, as a man
    who “had combined, with a remarkable legal erudition, great resources of
    scholarship. His judgments commanded the admiration of lawyers, not only
    for their penetration, their soundness and their correctness, but for the
    exposition of legal principles in an almost unequalled English style.” He
    was appointed to the High Court of Australia on 8 February 1950, and the
    question of Catholics and the Australian Constitution would be one of his
    early cases.
</p>
<p>
    Fullagar clarified Crittenden’s accusations. He wrote that “the petitioner
    made it quite clear to me that he did not allege that the respondent had
    entered into any individual or particular acknowledgement of adherence,
    obedience or allegiance to what he describes as the Papal State.” Which is
    to say, Crittenden’s argument was not that Anderson had specifically and
    explicitly, as an individual, sworn any allegiance to a foreign power.
    Instead, explained Justice Fullagar, Crittenden thought that “merely by
    virtue of being a professed member of the Roman Catholic Church, the
    respondent owes allegiance to a foreign power.” Fullagar continues to
    summarise the full implications of the argument for the relationship
    between Catholics and the Australian state: “What [Crittenden] is saying is
    no more and no less than that every member of [the Catholic Church] is the
    subject of a foreign power and for that reason incapable of becoming or
    being a member of either House of the Parliament of the Commonwealth.”
</p>
<p>
    The petition was widely covered in Australia’s major capital city and
    regional newspapers. The nation’s Catholic press, especially, took an
    interest. Shortly after the petition was delivered in January, Adelaide’s
    Catholic newspaper, the <em>Southern Cross</em>, editorialised on the matter: “There
    is a grave misconception here due to the fact that Mr. Crittenden fails to
    distinguish between temporal authority and spiritual authority – a mistake
    that could only be made in a very materialistic age. Is that a distinction
    Catholics make just to get out of a difficulty? Of course not.”
</p>
<p>
    The <em>Southern Cross</em> continued to explain: “Every Anglican in South Australia
    recognises [Thomas Playford, Premier of South Australia] as holding
    temporal and Bishop Robin spiritual authority over them. Every Australian
    Catholic hails the King as his temporal ruler, the Pope as his spiritual
    ruler. The Pope has temporal authority, too – but not over us. He has
    spiritual authority over all Catholics throughout the world; temporal
    authority only over the citizens of the Vatican State. The Australian
    Catholic, or any Catholic not a citizen of the Vatican State, owes no
    allegiance to the Pope as civil ruler. The fact that there is a Vatican
    State at all is non-essential and comparatively unimportant. It does not
    belong to the essence of the Papacy.”
</p>
<p>
    Fullagar’s own judgment and opinion of Crittenden’s argument was clear and
    unambiguous: “It is obvious, in my opinion, that no such major premiss
    [sic] can be supported.” What Crittenden was attempting to argue, thought
    Fullagar, was rather transparent, and spoke to old bigotries. The judge
    contended that the sovereignty of the Vatican was irrelevant to the
    question. He said that “the root of the matter … lies in the fact that the
    petitioner really seeks to revive a point of view which was abandoned in
    England in 1829”, referring legislative changes that allowed Catholics to
    sit and vote as a member of either house of parliament in the United
    Kingdom. Fullagar said that “our own Constitution was, of course, not
    enacted by men ignorant or unmindful of history” and noted that the
    Australian Constitution determines that “no religious test shall be
    required as qualification for any office or public trust under the
    Commonwealth … it is, in my opinion, sec. 116, and not sec. 44(i) of our
    Constitution which is relevant when the right of a member of any religious
    body to sit in Parliament is challenged on the ground of his religion.”
</p>
<p>
    Fullagar continues: “One may observe, as a matter of law, that every person
    born in Australia, into whatever religion he may be born and whatever
    religion he may embrace, is according to the law of this country (which is
    the only relevant law) a British subject owing allegiance to His Majesty,
    and of that allegiance he cannot rid himself except in certain prescribed
    ways. One may observe, as a matter of fact, that many thousands of
    Catholics have fought in the armed forces of this country in recent wars.”
</p>
<p>
    That Fullagar pointed towards Section 116 of the Australian Constitution in
    defence of the nation’s Catholics was apt. Half a century earlier, in the
    lead up to the Federation of the Australian colonies in 1901, Catholics had
    been ambiguous about the project, not least because the rhetoric
    surrounding Federation was distinctly British and imperial. Although he was
    a supporter, when Patrick Francis Cardinal Moran was informed that only the
    Anglican Primate would be allowed to read prayers and give blessings at the
    inauguration ceremonies, he led the Church in Australia in a boycott of
    Federation celebrations. Very few Catholics had participated in the
    preceding federal conventions that would decide the shape of the new
    Commonwealth. Only three of fifty delegates at the first convention in 1897
    were Catholic: Patrick McMahon Glynn, Richard O’Connor (described as “one
    lone Catholic in a sea of Protestants”), and Matthew Clarke. It was Glynn
    who, as one writer puts it, “is popularly remembered, if remembered at all,
    as the man who put God into the Australian Constitution.” With the support
    of Victorian Presbyterians, Glynn convinced the final convention in
    Melbourne to insert the phrase “humbly relying on the blessing of Almighty
    God” into the preamble of the Constitution. Most importantly for those
    Catholics who would later face questions about their faith and allegiance
    to a foreign power, Glynn had the convention insert Section 116 into the
    Australian Constitution: “the Commonwealth could not legislate to establish
    any religion, to impose any religious observance, to prohibit free exercise
    of any religion, or to impose any religious test for holding Commonwealth
    office.”
</p>
<p>
    In the end, Crittenden’s accusations were dismissed. In his judgment,
    Justice Fullagar determined that the arguments put forward were “quite
    untenable”, that they were not sufficient grounds for declaring the
    Anderson’s election void, and that “the petition shows on its face that it
    has no prospect for success, and that it is vexation and oppressive in the
    relevant sense.” The proceedings were “for ever stayed.” So unimpressed was
    Fullagar that instead of ordering Crittenden to pay fixed costs as was
    often the case, he crossed out the relevant phrases in his judgment and
    thereby opened the applicant to whatever costs Anderson had incurred
    defending himself. The judgment was published in full on the front page of
    Sydney’s Catholic Weekly newspaper, which proudly declared: “Catholic M. H.
    R. Wins Case: Religion No Bar To Election, Judge Declares”.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
    As the editors of the <em>Southern Cross</em> in Adelaide had predicted in February
    1950 as news of Crittenden’s petition first emerged: “No Australian
    Catholic is under any act of acknowledgement, allegiance, or obedience or
    adherence to the Vatican State, or is a subject or citizen entitled to the
    rights or privileges of a subject or citizen of the Vatican State.” As
    Fullagar had recognised, however, that point was irrelevant: the framers of
    the Australian Constitution had, fifty years earlier, defended believers
    against discrimination when it came to the question of public office.
    Gordon Anderson held the seat of Kingsford Smith until his eventual
    retirement in 1958.
