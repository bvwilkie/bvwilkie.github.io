<h1>Politics and place: On the restoration of Djabwurrung and Jardwadjali names to Grampians-Gariwerd</h1>
<p><i>This is the draft of an article currently under review with the Victorian Historical Journal. Citations have been removed. Comments and feedback are welcome at ben.wilkie@deakin.edu.au.</i>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In March 1989, the Warrnambool Standard announced on its front-page that the Grampians, ‘a range of mountains in north-west Victoria and named by a Scotsman with a fine sense of the ridiculous, will be renamed by a Scotsman with a fine sense of history.’ The latter Scot was the Victorian government minister, Steve Crabb, ‘who was born in Arboath near the foothills of the Scottish Grampians.’ The reportage made much of the Scottish connection: ‘Mr Crabb, whose ancestors demolished the Roman army’s famed ninth legion and thereby led to the building of Hadrian’s Wall, said yesterday, “Why on earth would we want to borrow a foreign and erroneous name at that, when the [Victorian] Grampians have been known for thousands of years as Guriward?”’ The Standard elaborated on how both the Scottish and Victorian Grampians came to be named:

<p><i>[Crabb] said that the Scots had fought a fiery battle with the Romans at the end of the first century AD [at a location] which a historian had called Mons Grapius. “However, the 16th century historian Hector Boece misspelt the name of the battle as Mons Grampius, and from the oversight the mountains became known as the Grampians,” Mr Crabb said. Victoria’s mountain range was name by Thomas Mitchell in 1836 … “When the white man came he wiped out thousands of years of civilisation and quite arbitrarily imposed names that were foreign and irrelevant”.</i> 

<p>The above declaration was the beginning of many years of heated debate and political conflict over the meaning and significance of Grampians-Gariwerd. This article explores the contemporary history of controversies surrounding the naming of the Grampians National Park that emerged in the late-1980s, and which continued throughout the 1990s under successive governments. Some of these issues remain unresolved to this day. While accounts exist of the initial public controversy, this article extends the history forward into the 1990s and explores further debate and issues around the dual naming of the park.  It incorporates evidence and materials unavailable at the time, including Victorian parliamentary documents and transcripts, and aims to develop a broader picture of the history of Grampians-Gariwerd in this era with a focus on drawing out political, public, and media debates over the significance and naming of the mountain ranges for Indigenous and non-Indigenous people.

<p>The history of the Grampians-Gariwerd debate has significance because the naming of places involves the projection of human values onto landscapes. As David Bruno-Wilson and Meredith Wilson observe, ‘social and personal expressions of place-marking signal a cultural presence and give the land social significance. At the same time, it is in the social construction of a sense of place that people’s identities unfold.’  Competition between traditional Indigenous names and newer European names can be seen as a battle of cultures and identities for ownership of the land. Landscapes are not merely 'out there' as physical spaces, measurable, and independent of cultures, described either accurately or inaccurately. Rather, landscapes can be understood as ‘the engagement of people in place, as experience of the world.’  They are ‘meaningful, socially constructed places involving bodily and cognitive experience... [they] exist in relation to the human actors who engage with them and imbue them with meaning.’  

<p>This article therefore explores the meaning and significance of the mountain ranges encompassed in the Grampians-Gariwerd national park for Australians both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, and suggests that such histories highlight how these important natural landscapes can become the sites of deeper cultural conflict. Indeed, as the first annual report of the barely weeks-old Victorian National Parks Authority observed in June 1957, ‘The National Parks of this State are reserved as samples of the Victorian countryside as Nature made it. They are the living and only true portrayal of the National character.’  The debate over Grampians-Gariwerd reflected both local concerns and occurred against the background of significant national issues, including the land rights and reconciliation movements. This important national context shaped State and local discussions around the use of Aboriginal place names and the naming of Grampians-Gariwerd.

<h2>Restoring Gariwerd to the Grampians National Park, 1989-1992</h2> 

<p>Crabb’s 1989 version of the events was relatively accurate. Before Mitchell in 1836, the Grampians landscape had only ever been described by the Indigenous people of the area. The Jardwadjali and Djabwurrung were the traditional owners of the landscape and features that would become known as the Grampians, while the Buandig, Wergaia, Dhauwurdwurrung, and Wathawurrung also had names for features in the area. Indigenous people had been there for over 20,000 years before the Europeans arrived. In the late-Pleistocene, Gariwerd was devoid of the schlerophyll forests that now cover its ranges. The mountains stood at the edge of an expanded arid interior zone – a place of shelter, and perhaps a base from which trade and hunting expeditions may begin or end. Evidence of permanent or semi-permanent villages has been found in the centre of the ranges, near Lake Wartook. Rock shelters were used for a variety of ceremonial and practical purposes, and it is within their protective overhangs that most Victorian rock art can be found. Some of this art depicts Bunjil, the creator, who took shelter within Gariwerd, which stands central in Indigenous cultural and material life.  

<p>When the Surveyor-General of New South Wales, Major Thomas Mitchell, arrived in western Victoria in the late-1830s and came upon the mountains, he re-named them ‘the Grampians’ after the ranges in his country of birth, Scotland. This was a break from his habit of seeking out Indigenous names for landscape features; some time beforehand, Mitchell’s party had encountered and massacred seven Indigenous people, and in the aftermath word had spread among the Indigenous groups of western Victoria that he and his expedition should be avoided. Although Mitchell found it both preferable and convenient to use local Aboriginal names whenever they could be ascertained, ‘it was not without some pride, as a Briton, that I, more majorum, gave the name of the Grampians to these extreme summits of the southern hemisphere.”  From 1836, therefore, the mountain ranges were known in official records and maps as the Grampians. 

<p>As scholars have observed, however, the Grampians ‘were central to the dreaming of buledji Brambimbula, the two brothers Bram, who were responsible for the creation and naming of many landscape features in western Victoria. Many of the Aboriginal placenames … are believed to be conferred by mythological Ancestors, and as such they are memorials to these mythic heroes. They record actions and events associated with Ancestors and many contain references to Ancestral body parts.’  But, as Gariwerd gave way to the Grampians, the landscape was secularised in a process we might describe as landscape iconoclasm. 

<p>After a significant period marked by European exploration, science, recreation, and industry, in 1907 a large proportion of the area became a State Forest, and sanctuary was declared over most of the Grampians by 1914. From the late 1930s, public calls for the creation of a park increased in frequency and prominence until, in 1951, a State Development Committee on National Parks recommended the creation of a Grampians national park. Some thirty years later, in 1981, the Land Conservation Council put forward its first plans for a park, and, finally, in 1984 the area was official proclaimed and protected as the Grampians National Park.  The Indigenous heritage of the mountains was retained with involvement of five Aboriginal traditional owner groups – brought together as the Brambuk organisation – representing a large portion of western Victoria.  

<p>Five years after the establishment of the park, in March 1989, Crabb commissioned Ian D. Clark and Ben Gunn – a historical geographer and archaeologist, respectively – to begin researching traditional names and to make suggestions for the restoration of Indigenous names to the Grampians.  This was against a background of nationally significant Indigenous movements and issues, including controversies surrounding the Bicentenary celebrations, the revival of the notion of a Treaty in 1987 under the Hawke Government, the beginning of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in 1988, and, more broadly, the emergence of newly-invigorated spheres of Aboriginal arts, media, and culture.  Of particular significance to the renaming Grampians-Gariwerd would be the 1992 Mabo land rights decision, which established communal native title as part of the common law of Australia and overturned the historical concept of terra nullius. The anxiety and turmoil that emerged in the wake of that decision, as well as the momentum for change in Indigenous affairs seized by the Keating Government, would both be reflected in debates about renaming the Grampians National Park. 

<p>In 1985, Gunn had already made submissions to the Victorian Tourism Commission, arguing that many of the European names were inappropriate, and that new names should be chosen in consultation with local Aboriginal groups.  Crabb did not approach Aboriginal communities from the outset, however, eliciting criticism from Framlingham Aboriginal Trust administrator, Geoff Clark, who characterised Crabb’s approach to the issue as ‘racist’, and said that, although he ‘supported changing the names … it was unfair Aborigines had not been asked what they wanted.’  Despite assurances from the Minister’s office that Aboriginal communities would be consulted, Clark warned that Crabb ‘and Major Mitchell are guilty of ignoring the Aborigines’ past and present association and ownership of the Grampians area which extends over thousands of years.’ In a statement, Clark continued: ‘Will Mr Crabb, with his paternalistic attitude, expect those Aborigines among us with dark faces to be selling trinkets or beads and performing corroborees for his tourist industry?’ 

<p>Non-Indigenous politicians and members of the public also reacted swiftly. One day after the announcement, a local Warrnambool politician, John McGrath, told The Standard that ‘people in the Grampians area would probably offended by the move’, and described the proposal as ‘ludicrous’.  As Laura Kostanksi and Ian D. Clark argued in 2009, ‘the non-Indigenous community in the Grampians region felt attached to non-Indigenous understandings of the landscape. The non-Indigenous community was not familiar with the Indigenous Jardwadjali and Djabwurrung landscapes of Gariwerd, and the most common human reaction to the unknown is fear and rejection.’  One notable public statement – in the form of a letter to the editor of The Age – exemplified the complicated nature of the debate over the Grampians’ meaning. One J. Fitzsimmons wrote a day after Crabb’s announcement that ‘the Minister for Tourism … wants to rewrite history by renaming one of Victoria’s more historic and scenic areas.’ Fitzsimmons continues:

<p><i>This would effectively deny recognition of the substantial human effort by Major Mitchell and his party more than 150 years ago to become the first Europeans to reach the area … Mr Crabb’s audacity is almost the equal of his ambiguity … There is some question as to the validity of any Aboriginal place name recommendations in The Grampians. This is based on the claim that there are no true descendants of The Grampians’ original inhabitants left … This exercise in audacity, if pursued, would set a dangerous precedent. Leave history, and The Grampians, alone Mr Crabb.</i> 

<p>There was evidence, therefore, of competing visions of the Grampians, their history, and their ownership. Indeed, the national issue of land rights formed important context to the conflict over the Grampians’ heritage. In May 1989, the deputy leader of the Nationals Party in Victoria, Bill McGrath drew attention in parliament to a petition of 11,000 signatures in opposition to the name change, and then linked the issue to Indigenous land rights. ‘Will the Minister for Tourism assure the House,’ asked McGrath, ‘that his unpopular push to rename the Grampians Guriwurd is not part of a hidden agenda to hand over the area to people who may claim to be traditional owners and then lease it back, is the case with Ayers Rock?’ 

<p>All but confirming such fears – which must be contextualised against the ongoing debate around Indigenous land rights – in June 1990, a Labor Aboriginal Affairs policy committee recommended that Gariwerd be ‘handed over to Victorian Aboriginal communities and leased back to the state Government’. The committee argued that the State government ‘should go further in recognising Aboriginal ownership of the park’ and called upon Labor ‘to strengthen its commitment to granting Victorian Aborigines land-rights and compensation for the unlawful dispossession and dispersal of their lands.’ The committee recommended that ownership of the Park be transferred to the Indigenous community, and that the State Conservation and Environment Department would lease back the Grampians.  Indeed, a year later, in August 1991, the Victorian Labor government suggested it would introduce a bill granting Indigenous Victorians ‘the right to reclaim Crown land and national parks. National parks would be handed over subject to lease-back deals with the Government, such as at Uluru in the Northern Territory. The first such land claims would be made on the Grampians and Wilsons Promontory, both of which host significant Aboriginal sites.’  Just a few months later, however, the government and Crabb himself backed away from the commitment. 

<p>The Victorian government, of course, had yet to even change the name of the Grampians. In an attempt to quell fears, the Minister for Property and Services, Ron Walsh, said in June 1990 that ‘no decision to change the name of the national park would be made until there had been extensive public consultation.’ Walsh said that ‘he hoped a decision on the proposal could be made without hysteria,’ and that ‘because of the sensitive nature of the proposal, the [place-names committee] would be canvassing as many authorities as possible for their written comments.’   As historian and poet Tony Birch observed in 1992, many of the responses to the consultation process reflected an anxiety about ownership of land and history: ‘An attempt to recognise the history of indigenous people creates insecurity, paranoia, even hysteria’, argued Birch.  Responses submitted abounded with references to the potential to ‘wipe out’ British history, consigning the heritage of settlers to ‘the scrapheap of history’, and the fear that familiar places and their pasts would ‘disappear from the map’.  The Hamilton Spectator argued in May 1990 that Crabb should ‘leave history as it stands’.  This history was not, evidentially, Indigenous Australian history.

<p>Despite these controversies, sixteen months after the initial announcement Clark and co-author Lionel Harradine submitted their final report to the Victorian Place Names Committee. The researchers had identified and documented eighty-six place names in and around the national park, along with nine preferred names for rock art sites. These names were derived from the words and vocabulary of nineteenth-century Jardwadjali and Djabwurrung speakers – the traditional owners of the land that formed the Grampians National Park. Clark and Harridine argued that there was ‘a very strong case for the restoration of Aboriginal place names and for the ascertaining and publishing of the meanings of these words. … Just as there is now a very definite interest and awareness of the need to maintain what has been left of Koorie life, culture, rock art and traditions, so there should be a growing awareness for the need to preserve Koorie place names.’  Of the name of the mountain ranges encompassed by the Grampians National Park, Clark and Harridine noted their research suggested that ‘the Grampians Ranges were traditionally known as Gariwerd. Gariwerd, recorded by George Robinson on the 11th of June, 1841, as “Currewart”, was obtained at Coonongwootong station from Jardwadjali speakers.’  Explaining the etymology of Gariwerd, the researchers continued:

<p><i>Gariwerd is a compound noun. Gar means ‘pointed mountain’ and is cognate with the word for ‘nose’. The –i is the particularizing suffix, which translates into ‘the’. Werd means ‘shoulder’ and appears in ‘werdug’ (pronounced werdook) ‘his shoulder’, the correct form for ‘Wartook’. The compound simply means ‘The Mountain Range’, and is descriptive and specialized for the mountain range Mitchell subsequently named ‘The Grampians’.</i>

<p>Crabb and the Victorian Labor government thus set about renaming the park and its features with traditional Indigenous names. Importantly, in 1991 no legislation existed in Victoria that allowed for landscape features to have both Indigenous and settler names. There was no formal process for dual naming, and thus renaming the park and ranges would seem at the time to mean either removing ‘Grampians’ and replacing it with ‘Gariwerd’ and other traditional names for features in the ranges, or implementing new hybrid, Anglo-Indigenous names.  With the support of Brambuk, the latter method of de-facto dual-naming would prevail as a compromise solution. 

<p>In October 1991, Crabb announced that the Victorian Place Names Committee had decided to restore forty-nine of the recommended place names, rejected fifteen, and ask for further investigation into four more. The park was subsequently renamed Grampians (Gariwerd) National Park, and many other landscape features received dual names, including: Yananginj Njawi Gap (Victoria Gap); Mount Sturgeon (Mount Wurgarri) and Mount Marum Marum (Mount Nelson). The changes would be accompanied by a $1 million promotional campaign. Crabb maintained his enthusiasm for the changes, saying that the ‘Koori link is what can give a magnificent and rugged mountain range the depth and magic that distinguishes it from other spectacular mountain scenery.’ The mayor of nearby Stawell, however, said he was incensed that one man [Crabb] can defy the wishes of the electorate,’ and that ‘the name changes were the first step in handing control of the area to Aborigines.’ 

<p>The Labor government decision to change the name of the Grampians remained controversial, and the Liberal and National parties continued to attack and ridicule the move on various grounds. In October 1991, the Liberal Whip in the Victorian Legislative Council, Richard de Fegely argued against the name change from the point of view of cost. He said to the upper house: ‘The government is determined to change the name of the Grampians at enormous cost when the State is going down the gurgler and people are unemployed in their thousands. The government will spend $1 million to advertise the name change. We will have to change maps, notices, road signs and the like. Surely the State would be better off by putting off that name change until farther down the track when Victoria can afford it.’  The cost of changing the name of the national park was a recurring theme in arguments against the proposal. Shortly after de Fegely’s suggestion, Liberal upper-house member Ken Smith noted his ‘concern about the recent name change made to the Grampians.’ He continued:

<p><i>The funds for that name change must have been transferred from Aboriginal affairs to conservation and environment so that Mr Crabb could pay for some of the work that has been done, such as identifying some of the Aboriginal tribes that lived in the Grampians area, to discover their correct names and so on. I am not sure how much money that cost the Victorian taxpayer; I am not sure how many Aboriginal tribes lived in the area. I am sure Mr Crabb, who is of Scottish descent, would not know too much about the Aboriginal people up there. How can he rename our Grampians? There was no community support for funds to be allocated for the name changes in the Grampians.</i>  

<p>Indeed, the question of community support was another theme in objections to the proposal to change the name. Politicians who opposed the move, however, did so from the perspective of non-Indigenous communities. Even the Scottish Council of Clans considered renaming the Grampians as ‘a threat to Scottish heritage and pioneers’.  Echoing earlier some voices in the debate, Smith went as far as to question whether the mountain ranges had any relevant Indigenous cultural heritage or history at all. ‘I remember the beauty of the place,’ he said, ‘but I cannot remember anything about Aboriginal tribes living there. I cannot remember any signs or plaques saying that such and such a tribe actually lived in that area. I do not know where Mr Crabb got his idea from. Perhaps it came to him in the middle of the night and he said, “Eureka”, or whatever is the Aboriginal translation, “I am going to change the name of the Grampians.”’ Indeed, Smith ultimately suggested that the name change was ‘because the government is in its death throes and is trying to do some things to grab the Aboriginal vote … It has attempted to do that by the renaming of the Grampians.’  This sentiment was echoed in a letter from the mayor of Stawell, who said that ‘It seems to me more like a little group that can get what it wants like all the minority groups. The government just bows down to them and the government is ruled by the loudest noise all the time.’ 

<p>The notion that the name change was not to be taken seriously was another line of criticism, with parliamentarians referring repeatedly to the choice of name, whether it could be remembered, and whether it could be pronounced – ‘Garryowen, or something like that!’, joked Ballarat Liberal politician Rob Knowles.   In September 1991, the opposition member for Ripon, Tom Austin, described the name change as a ‘gimmick’ and ‘a stupid decision!’ He argued that the Indigenous names chosen were ‘ones that people could not pronounce or spell.’  Arguing that conservation funding was being misspent and Victoria’s national parks were being mismanaged under the Labor government, the Nationals spokesperson on the environment, David Evans, said in August 1992:

<p><i>There have been expensive programs … such as the promotion of the name change of the Grampians to Gariwerd. Mr Crabb declared a new name for a park everybody knows as the Grampians – even the Victorian National Parks Association has not been able to fall into line with it. One year after having spent hundreds of thousands of dollars promoting the name change the latest issue of the Victorian National Parks Association Newsletter of 7 August 1992 refers to the Grampians National Park. Following the disgraced and discredited Mr Crabb in his program as Minister, the same government wants to declare the Murray-Sunset National Park Yanga Nyawi, even before the Place Names Committee has agreed to it. The government is ignoring the starving kangaroos and emus swimming the Murray in their droves to New South Wales; they would have appreciated a few dollars spent on feed from that $500,000 spent on glossy brochures.</i> 

<p>In the October 1992 state election – just twelve months after final decision with regard to Indigenous naming was made – Jeff Kennett’s Liberal-National Coalition defeated Joan Kirner’s Labor government, which was by then into its third term and electorally unpopular. Crabb’s attempts to have Djabwurrung and Jardwadjali place names restored to signage, maps, and official documentation were brought abruptly to a halt under the new government and, although public attention had been directed to the Grampians’ Indigenous heritage, little headway had been made in either formal government or popular recognition of ‘Gariwerd’ or other Aboriginal place names. 

<p>The brief episode had, however, highlighted the unease with which many Victorians responded to Indigenous claims on a landscape that non-Indigenous people had by now embedded with their own significance and meaning. As local writer Gib Wettenhall observed in retrospect, ‘citizens in townships surrounding the Grampians fought the reintroduction of aboriginal place names as a major election issue on the grounds that Aboriginal clans had rarely visited the ranges. The citizens saw their indigenous antecedents as playing no part in creating their floral wonderland.’  The government’s reversal thus seemed to meet some local non-Indigenous community expectations at the time, but events of more national significance would compound the issue well into the 1990s. In any case, competing understandings of the Grampians-Gariwerd landscape and deep cultural tensions had been revealed within the Victorian community.

<h2>Rights and reconciliation, 1992-1998</h2>

<p>The Kennett government was elected to power in the midst of a number of significant national debates on Indigenous affairs and issues. These issues were, in particular, the legal recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander land rights and the beginnings of the Reconciliation movement, which had emerged in response to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody as an attempt to reorganise relations between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. In 1992, the newly-formed Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation presented its first triennial strategic plan to the Federal Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. It argued that 

<p><i>Reconciliation is about bringing indigenous and other Australians together in mutual respect so that we can gain: a greater understanding of the importance of land and sea in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander society; better relationships between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and the wider community; recognition that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture is a valued part of Australian heritage; and, a sense for all Australians of a shared ownership of their history.</i> 

<p>The Coalition election campaign did little to reassure Victoria’s Aboriginal communities that, if elected, it would take these matters seriously. The Opposition spokesperson on Aboriginal affairs, Michael John, released the Coalition’s Aboriginal affairs policy on the eve of the election, with no official launch. In contrast to the ‘usual glossy policy brochures’, the document consisted of five stapled pages, and was criticised by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commissioner, Alf Bamblett, who told the Age that the policy ‘was so far off base it's not funny … the coalition does not consider Aboriginal affairs a major policy area’.  Indeed, the policy warned Aboriginal people that they ‘should fully understand that it will not be the intention of government to create a privileged group of people with special laws and ongoing privileges not available to other citizens.’ John said that the Labor government had ‘acted insensitively in renaming landmarks, including the Grampians (Gariwerd), with their Aboriginal names. He supported dual names, but only where the local people had been consulted.’  

<p>From the first proposal in March 1989 to the announcement of the new names in October 1991, it had been the Coalition’s policy to overturn the name changes once in a position to do so.  Shortly after their election, the new conservation minister, Mark Birrell, announced that ‘Gariwerd’ would be removed from the name of the Grampians National Park. The decision was described as ‘a slap in the face for Koori culture’. Geoff Clark, now chairman of Brambuk, told the Age that ‘Governments come and go but Aboriginal heritage can be struck out or recognised at the stroke of a pen, it seems’. He said that the ‘reconciliation process was meant to recognise Aboriginal heritage and foster a common understanding … Yet you have a Government come to power that completely disregards Koori culture.’ In response to the decision, Brambuk said it would remove all mentions of ‘Grampians’ from their signage and documentation, and committed to only using ‘Gariwerd’ in the future.  An editorial in the Sunday Age described the dual-naming of the park in 1991 as ‘a small, symbolic, and fine step along the path to reconciliation between black and white’, but said that Birrell’s move was ‘small-minded and arrogant.’ Moving to land rights, the editorial continued: 

<p><i>With its judgment in the Mabo case, the High Court has demolished effectively the legal fiction that Australia was terra nullius – no one's land – when Europeans arrived. In its own way, the renaming of the Grampians was a recognition that a people walked the land and worked it into their culture in a rich way that has tested the understanding of Europeans. They did not give up the land easily. They were dispossessed by force, or the threat of it, and that is the historical truth of it. Today, Aborigines in Victoria proudly call themselves Koories. It is their own word, and they seek their own place in their ancestors’ land. The struggle is difficult. But Aborigines have much to offer this society – different insights, different dimensions. They even seem willing to forgive the sins of the past. The renaming of the area the Grampians (Gariwerd) National Park was regarded by Koories as a reasonable compromise. To any right-thinking person, it was much more than that. Last week, the Government took a step backwards from reconciliation.</i> 

<p>Indeed, such was the impact of the decision that the Age would editorialise on the issue again a fortnight later. In the wake of the Prime Minister’s now-famous Redfern speech, the next editorial argued that ‘as Mr Keating spoke, Aborigines could reflect upon how little has changed and how – four years after similar fine sentiments were expressed during the Bicentennial celebrations – they are so often treated with indifference and hostility.’ Pointing to the decision to remove ‘Gariwerd’ from the name of the Grampians National Park as an example of this hostility, the writer argued: ‘Mr Birrell's action was hardly the high-water mark in the reconciliation process but it doubtless appealed to those who live in thoughtless dread of the repercussions of the High Court's Mabo decision and seek to deny Aborigines any recognition at all.’  The decision to rename the Grampians without reference to its Aboriginal heritage therefore seems to have jarred with a new public and political interest in Indigenous Australian land rights and reconciliation in the early-1990s.

<p>Letters from members of the public expressed similar concern and disappointment with the decision. ‘Shame on you, Mr Birrell, for abandoning Gariwerd. … What else have you and your party in store for the Kooris?’ asked Brian Stegley. Another joked: ‘You little beauty, Mr Birrell. Changing the Aboriginal word Gariwerd to the Scottish Grampians will teach them who's running the state. If they don't like it, they can go back to...um.’ A spokesperson of Action for World Development wrote that they were ‘appalled by Mr Birrell's decision to drop the name Gariwerd. This is a slap in the face to Koori culture and, in the light of next year's International Year of Indigenous People, quite incomprehensible.’  Another argued, ‘Mr Birrell's claim that dual names had confused people is no justification for his actions. As an elected community representative, Mr Birrell should, in my opinion, be promoting acceptance and understanding of Aboriginal culture within Australian society, so that such confusion will not occur in the future.’  One tourist wrote: ‘In Scotland, I live north of the Grampians, but when in Victoria I would rather visit Gariwerd. It sounds, and is, much more romantic. There are thousands of years of history behind the name Gariwerd, while, in Scotland, the word Grampian is but a modern misspelling of an unidentified hill.’  

<p>Clive Rosewarne, writing for the Friends of the Earth, argued that Thomas Mitchell would have used the name Gariwerd if had been able to, and that the ‘withdrawal of the name Gariwerd is an insult to the Aboriginal people’. He said that ‘taking this action on the eve of the International Year of Indigenous People tells the rest of the world that Victoria is stepping back into its colonialist past.’  A cultural officer with Brambuk in Halls Gap, Tim Chatfield, told one reporter 

<p><i>the name Grampians is not the true name. It is only a Scottish name that has been brought upon us here. The name has been taken away from us once but I guarantee it won't be taken away a second time. Some of the sites are over 20,000 years old. It is part of our heritage where we need to take our young children, or younger generation of Aboriginal people, to learn the stories. This is what government departments don't appreciate.</i> 

<p>The response to Birrell’s move went beyond the public expression of anger at the government. At the request of Aboriginal community leaders in Victoria, the Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Robert Tickner, withheld $210,000 of funding for Indigenous law enforcement services in Victoria. He argued that the new Coalition government’s policies had been ‘divisive’ and pointed to the Grampians-Gariwerd naming decision as one of many government decisions that had ‘contributed towards the deterioration in relations with the Aboriginal community, which are now at a critical point.’ The Minister said that ‘the new Victorian Government needed to come to grips with the reality of the 1990s – that Aboriginal people were not a marginal issue and that Government had a role to respect and act on their aspirations.’  Opinion writer, Martin Flanagan, argued that 

<p><i>The impact of white culture on Aboriginal society did not start and end in 1788. It continues. Furthermore, the beliefs underpinning the original assumption of the country are still in circulation. … The Kennett Government removed the name Gariwerd from the Grampians because, the minister said, it caused confusion. If that rationale were repeated in an international forum, the speaker would be laughed from the room.</i> 

<p>Indeed, the land rights debate and Mabo High Court decision in 1992 had a marked influence not only on concerns around whether the Grampians National Park should include Indigenous names, and what consequences this would have, but also on the future direction of discussion about the park’s Indigenous heritage more broadly. When the decision to drop ‘Gariwerd’ was announced, one Aboriginal spokesperson said that it was ‘being treated as a hiccup compared with the implications of the Mabo case, that has given local Aboriginal groups renewed hope of making a land claim on the national park.’  By the middle of 1996, an indecisive native title claim had been lodged by Gunditjmara traditional owners over parts of south-west Victoria, including some southern areas of the Grampians. This was amid a flurry of applications to the Native Title Tribunal by Aboriginal communities across Australia in the mid-1990s seeking to claim both Crown land and land within national parks and other conservation areas. 

<p>Further to this, in addition to land rights and Reconciliation, a new issue emerged in the sphere of Australian Aboriginal affairs that would further determine government attitudes towards Indigenous rights and recognition. In 1997, the Report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families was released. Better known as the Bringing Them Home report, the inquiry had investigated Australia’s history of ‘laws, practices and policies which resulted in the separation of Indigenous children from their families by compulsion, duress or undue influence’.  The report alleged cultural genocide, and called for reparations and an official apology. State governments, churches, and police forces issued apologies, while the federal government under Prime Minister John Howard famously refused to do so. In September 1997, Premier Kennett issued an apology in the Victorian Legislative Assembly. He said that the parliament ‘apologises to the Aboriginal people on behalf of all Victorians for the past policies under which Aboriginal children were removed from their families and expresses deep regret at the hurt and distress this has caused and reaffirms its support for reconciliation between all Australians.’  

<p>The apology represented a noticeable change from the Coalition’s approach to Aboriginal affairs in the election of 1992. Bringing Them Home, the debate over land rights, and the Reconciliation process had given impetus to a change in political and public attitudes towards Indigenous affairs. The Victorian government had been roundly criticised for dropping Gariwerd from the title of the Grampians National Park, but by the late-1990s, the debate had broadly shifted away from the issue of whether or not Aboriginal recognition and rights should be addressed, and had moved towards discussions of how and when these issues would be dealt with. 

<h2>Recognising the importance of place: 1998 to the present</h2>

<p>Within this context, the matter of Aboriginal place names emerged once again. In 1995, the Victorian Place Names Committee guidelines began to encourage the use of Aboriginal place names where the relevant Aboriginal community groups had been consulted and an agreement had been made.  In 1998, Liberal member for Seymour, Marie Tehan, presented a bill to the parliament that sought to alter the processes by which Victorian places were named. What would eventually become the Victorian Geographic Place Names Act 1998 formally decentralised decision-making processes from the Place Names Committee, and would empower local and regional communities to choose and change place names. Changes to places of Victorian or national significance would be reviewed by an expert advisory committee that included members with knowledge of history, heritage, and Indigenous culture and language, among other specialisations. 

<p>Tehan argued that ‘Geographic place names serve two major purposes. The primary purpose is the practical need to identify localities and features and to communicate direction. Place names also express tangibly the human activity of investing the landscape with meaning and memory.’  The parliamentary discussions of the bill reflected a more sophisticated understanding of place and identity than was revealed in earlier debates around Grampians-Gariwerd. Labor member, Sheryl Garbutt, argued that ‘The bill is important to the community because names preserve our heritage. They tell of our culture, our history, the state and the people. Names are often used symbolically to reflect our historic events.’ Martin Dixon, the Liberal member for Dromana, observed that 

<p><i>Place names affect our lives in important ways, most of which we are unaware of until we start investigating them. For many years people all over the world have attached meaning to the places they name. A place could be given a name because of its geographical feature, because it is a site of significance, or because it reminds the person of home. We do the same thing in our own lives and extend the practice to our naming of places and things in the wider community.</i>

<p>Throughout the reading of the bill, members made frequent references to Aboriginal place names. Liberal upper-house member, John Ross pointed out, for instance, that 

<p><i>given the rich history of Bunurong people and the extent to which their lives were documented, I record my disappointment that as far as I have been able to ascertain there is not one street, road or locality in my electorate that celebrates their ancient history, and I take the opportunity of the passage of this important legislation to call on the relevant municipalities to give early consideration to correcting that anomaly</i> 

<p>David Lean, then the Liberal Party representative of Carrum, commended the bill for its ‘cultural and heritage significance.’ He focused on particular on Aboriginal place names, and observed that ‘when the name of Ayers Rock is registered as Uluru it has a magical quality. It is the same with the Olgas, or Kata Juta; they too have that magic.’ Lean pointed out that the bill made provisions for Indigenous culture and argued ‘many  difficulties will be solved with its introduction.’  Indeed, the guidelines accompanying the Geographic Place Names Act, first released in January 1999, consistently encouraged the use of Aboriginal place names and have set out processes for dual naming.  The Act and the parliamentary discussion around it reflected a shifting perception of the cultural significance of place names for Indigenous and non-Indigenous Victorians alike. 

<p>Significantly, changes to the ways in which Victorian places were named opened up the possibility for a return of ‘Gariwerd’ to the Grampians National Park. Although the Kennett government halted moves to rename the national park in 1992, since that time ‘Gariwerd’ had entered public vocabulary. The Friends of Grampians group, established in 1984, changed its name to Friends of Grampians Gariwerd in 1997 because it ‘wanted to more formally recognise the importance of the Park to the indigenous peoples.’  Throughout the 1990s, travel writers and media reports referred, inconsistently and variously, to ‘Grampians/Gariwerd’ and ‘Grampians (Gariwerd)’, as did politicians. The debate sparked in 1989 by Crabb had spread awareness of the park’s Indigenous culture, heritage, and names. Indeed, when he was later interviewed about the controversy, Crabb revealed that his approach to the proposal was in fact intended to create controversy and publicity for the park. In her study of public responses to Indigenous place naming, Laura Kostanski argued that Crabb and a local tourism lobbyist ‘had not only purposefully created a controversy with which to announce the name restoration proposal, but they had also continued to fan the fires of opposition to ensure publicity for [the Grampians].’ Kostanski found, however, that those who initially objected to the name change were not any more inclined to support Indigenous place names for the Grampians nearly two decades later. Crabb himself was non-committal.  

<p>The naming of the park varies to this day. The Commonwealth National Heritage List registers it as ‘Grampians National Park (Gariwerd)’, as does the Victorian National Parks Association, while Parks Victoria refers to ‘Grampians National Park’ in its official documentation.  Signage in and around the park is similarly inconsistent. In 2014, Jeremy Clark – then executive officer of Brambuk – told a Victorian parliamentary inquiry into heritage tourism and ecotourism 

<p><i>We would like to see things like the name of the national park revert to its traditional name of Gariwerd. We would like to see dual signage at the very least throughout the park, for the Aboriginal story to be told in the park. The park is marketed on its natural assets, and that is great, but there is a whole layer of Aboriginal heritage that is not part of it. If that happens, it will lift the profile of Aboriginal people and the profile of our heritage ... I would love Aboriginal culture and heritage to be incorporated across the board, whether it is names, information or experiences. It should not be a difficult thing, but it has been in the past. It could be the start of something.</i> 

<p>It has, indeed, been a difficult process. Since 1989, Grampians-Gariwerd has been a site for contesting visions of Australia’s history and heritage, and it has reflected national debates around Indigenous rights, reconciliation, and recognition. As this article has explored, the Grampians have been the subject of intense controversies over the place of Indigenous names on the landscape. But, as Clark attested to, Grampians-Gariwerd also holds potential as a site for future recognition of Aboriginal history, heritage, and culture. What its history since the late 1980s demonstrates is that understandings of the park have been in a complex relationship with not only local and regional concerns, but also issues and movements of national significance.
